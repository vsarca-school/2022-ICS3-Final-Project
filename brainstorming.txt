IDEA 1: PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
Flaws with processing:
- Hard to make things look good
- Only shapes and things, image and other support is limited
Flaws with making a new programming language
- We just parse the thing as javascript, replace drawing commands with canvas commands, and maybe replace syntax
    - Why is this a flaw? Too simple ot execute (I can make this in <1 class)
    - We cant make this a difficult project, its just not possible, its too easy with javascript

IDEA 2: CHESS COMPUTER
Flaws with idea:
    - Don't get the 2% bonus, unless we can come up with a way it helps computer science teachers?
        - Only if we have some kind of learning aspect together with it

IDEA 3: AI PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
Matlab is a language used for its really fast matrix multiplication
Why don't we make a language for simpler AI creation?
- Neural network specific
Pros:
- For computer science, so gets 2%
- Decent workload (I'll do the AI part dw guys)
Cons:
- Idk what to put here tbh, this idea is golden
