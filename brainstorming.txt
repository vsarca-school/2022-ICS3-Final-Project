IDEA 1: PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
Flaws with processing:
- Hard to make things look good
- Only shapes and things, image and other support is limited
Flaws with making a new programming language
- We just parse the thing as javascript, replace drawing commands with canvas commands, and maybe replace syntax
    - Why is this a flaw? Too simple ot execute (I can make this in <1 class)
    - We cant make this a difficult project, its just not possible, its too easy with javascript

IDEA 2: CHESS COMPUTER
Flaws with idea:
    - Don't get the 2% bonus
